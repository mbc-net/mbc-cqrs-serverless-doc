  "CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)": "CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)",
  "The command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern separates the data mutation, or the command part of a system, from the query part. You can use the CQRS pattern to separate updates and queries if they have different requirements for throughput, latency, or consistency. The CQRS pattern splits the application into two parts—the command side and the query side. The command side handles create, update, and delete requests. The query side runs the query part by using the read replicas.": "The command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern separates the data mutation, or the command part of a system, from the query part.

  "Event Sourcing": "Event Sourcing",
  "The event sourcing pattern is typically used with the CQRS pattern to decouple read from write workloads, and optimize for performance, scalability, and security. Data is stored as a series of events, instead of direct updates to data stores. Microservices replay events from an event store to compute the appropriate state of their own data stores. The pattern provides visibility for the current state of the application and additional context for how the application arrived at that state. The event sourcing pattern works effectively with the CQRS pattern because data can be reproduced for a specific event, even if the command and query data stores have different schemas.": "The event sourcing pattern is typically used with the CQRS pattern to decouple read from write workloads, and optimize for performance, scalability, and security.
