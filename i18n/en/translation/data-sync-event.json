  "The data sync event is a particularly significant custom event because it is one of the most commonly registered events within the application. Handlers for this event play a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and synchronization between different databases. For example, a handler might be responsible for syncing data from DynamoDB to RDS, sending registration emails, and executing other related tasks that maintain the integrity and flow of data across the application.": "The data sync event is a particularly significant custom event because it is one of the most commonly registered events within the application.
