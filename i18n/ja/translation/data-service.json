  "DataService": "DataService",
  "Overview": "",
  "The `DataService` is the query side of the CQRS pattern, providing efficient read operations for data stored in DynamoDB. It handles all read operations from the data table (the read model) which is optimized for queries.": "",
  "CQRS Query Side": "",
  "Application": "",
  "Data Table": "",
  "Query Results": "",
  "Before using the DataService, you need to set up the CommandModule as described in [the previous section](./command-module.md).": "",
  "Methods": "メソッド",
  "*async* `getItem(key: DetailKey)`": "*async* `getItem(key: DetailKey)`",
  "The `getItem` method returns a set of attributes for the item with the given detail/primary key. If there is no matching item, `getItem` does not return any data and there will be no item element in the response.": "`getItem` メソッドは、指定された詳細キー/主キーを持つアイテムの属性のセットを返します。一致するアイテムがない場合、`getItem` はデータを返さず、応答には item 要素がありません。",
  "Example:": "例",
  "*async* `listItemsByPk(pk: string, opts?: ListItemsOptions)`": "",
  "The `listItemsByPk` method returns one or more items matching the partition key. It supports filtering, pagination, and sorting.": "",
  "Basic Usage": "",
  "List all items by primary key (`pk`):": "",
  "With Sort Key Filter": "",
  "List items by primary key (`pk`) and use a filter expression on the sort key (`sk`). For example, get items where the sort key starts with `CAT#` and limit to 100 items:": "",
  "Pagination": "",
  "Implement pagination using `exclusiveStartKey` and `limit`:": "",
  "Sort Key Operators": "",
  "The following sort key expressions are supported:": "",
