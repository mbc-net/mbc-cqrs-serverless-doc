  "This guide explains how to build type-safe forms with validation using React Hook Form and Zod. These patterns ensure data integrity before sending to the API and provide clear feedback to users.": "",
  "When to Use This Guide": "",
  "Use this guide when you need to:": "",
  "Build forms for creating and editing entities (products, users, orders)": "",
  "Validate user input before submitting to the API": "",
  "Display field-level error messages to users": "",
  "Handle complex forms with dynamic fields (order items, tags)": "",
  "Show conditional fields based on other form values": "",
  "Problems This Pattern Solves": "",
  "Problem": "",
  "Solution": "",
  "Invalid data sent to API": "",
  "Zod validates before submission": "",
  "Type mismatch between form and API": "",
  "Infer TypeScript types from Zod schema": "",
  "Form re-renders on every keystroke": "",
  "React Hook Form uses uncontrolled inputs": "",
  "Hard to show validation errors": "",
  "Automatic error state per field": "",
  "Dynamic fields are complex to manage": "",

  "Use Case: Product Create Form": "",
  "Scenario: User needs to create a new product with code, name, price, and status.": "",
  "Solution: Define schema with validation rules, create form component that displays errors.": "",
  "Zod Schema Definition": "Zodスキーマ定義",
  "Define validation rules that match your API requirements:": "",
  "Form Component": "フォームコンポーネント",
  "Connect the schema to React Hook Form:": "",
  "Reusable Form Components": "再利用可能なフォームコンポーネント",
  "Use Case: Consistent Form Field Styling": "",
  "Scenario: All form fields should have consistent label, error display, and required indicator.": "",
  "Solution: Create a wrapper component that handles common field UI.": "",
  "Use Case: Input with Error State": "",
  "Scenario: Input should visually indicate validation errors.": "",
  "Advanced Form Patterns": "高度なフォームパターン",
  "Use Case: Order Form with Multiple Items": "",
  "Scenario: User creates an order with multiple line items. Items can be added or removed.": "",
  "Problem: Managing array of fields with validation is complex.": "",
  "Solution: useFieldArray provides add, remove, and update methods with proper validation.": "",
  "Use Case: Payment Form with Conditional Fields": "",
  "Scenario: Form shows different fields based on payment method selection.": "",
  "Problem: Need to watch a field value and conditionally render other fields.": "",
  "Solution: useWatch subscribes to field changes without causing full form re-render.": "",

  "Scenario: Submit form data to API and handle success/error states.": "",
  "Solution: Container component combines form with React Query mutation.": "",
  "Use Case: Edit Product with Pre-populated Data": "",
  "Scenario: Load existing product data into form for editing.": "",
  "Problem: Need to fetch data before rendering form with default values.": "",
  "Solution: Container fetches data, passes to form as defaultValues.": "",
  "Complex Validation Patterns": "複雑なバリデーションパターン",
  "Use Case: Date Range Validation": "",
  "Scenario: End date must be after start date.": "",
  "Solution: Use Zod refine to validate across multiple fields.": "",
  "Use Case: Unique Code Validation": "",
  "Scenario: Product code must not already exist in database.": "",
  "Problem: Need to call API to check uniqueness.": "",
  "Solution: Use async refine to validate against API.": "",
  "Best Practices": "ベストプラクティス",
  "1. Colocate Schemas with Forms": "1. スキーマをフォームと同じ場所に配置する",
