  "Learn how to implement service layer with CRUD operations using CommandService and DataService.": "CommandServiceとDataServiceを使用したCRUD操作によるサービスレイヤーの実装方法を学びます。",
  "Service Implementation Patterns": "Service実装パターン",
  "This guide explains how to implement service classes that handle CRUD operations in MBC CQRS Serverless. Services are the core of your business logic, coordinating between controllers, commands, and data access.": "",
  "When to Use This Guide": "",
  "Use this guide when you need to:": "",
  "Build a service layer for a new domain entity": "",
  "Implement create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations": "",
  "Handle multi-tenant data isolation": "",
  "Use optimistic locking for concurrent updates": "",
  "Implement batch operations for bulk data processing": "",
  "Problems This Pattern Solves": "",
  "Problem": "",
  "Solution": "",
  "Direct database access bypasses CQRS pattern": "",
  "Use CommandService for writes, DataService for reads": "",
  "No audit trail for data changes": "",
  "Pass invokeContext to capture user and timestamp": "",
  "Concurrent updates overwrite each other": "",
  "Use version field for optimistic locking": "",
  "Slow responses due to synchronous processing": "",
  "Use publishAsync for non-blocking command publishing": "",
  "Basic Service Structure": "基本的なService構造",
  "A typical service uses both `CommandService` for write operations and `DataService` for read operations:": "一般的なサービスは、書き込み操作に`CommandService`、読み取り操作に`DataService`の両方を使用します：",
  "Create Operation": "Create操作",
  "Use Case: Create a New Product": "",
  "Scenario: User submits a form to add a new product to the catalog.": "",
  "Flow: Controller receives CreateProductDto → Service generates keys → Command published to DynamoDB → Data synced to RDS.": "",
  "Read Operations": "Read操作",
  "Find One by Key": "キーによる単一取得",
  "Use Case: Get Product Detail Page": "",
  "Scenario: User navigates to a product detail page and needs the full product data.": "",
  "When to use: Single-item lookup where you have the pk and sk.": "",
  "Find All with Pagination (from RDS)": "ページネーション付き全件取得（RDSから）",
  "Use Case: Product List with Filtering": "",
  "Scenario: Display a paginated product list that users can filter by category or search.": "",
  "Why RDS: DynamoDB is not optimized for complex queries. Use Prisma/RDS for filtering and full-text search.": "",
  "Update Operation": "Update操作",
  "Use Case: Edit Product Details": "",
  "Scenario: User updates product name or price through an edit form.": "",
  "Important: Include the version field to enable optimistic locking and prevent concurrent update conflicts.": "",
  "Delete Operation (Soft Delete)": "Delete操作（論理削除）",
  "Use Case: Remove Product from Catalog": "",
  "Scenario: Admin removes a discontinued product.": "",
  "Why Soft Delete: Data is marked as deleted (isDeleted=true) rather than physically removed, preserving audit history.": "",
  "Complete Service Example": "完全なService例",
  "Here is a complete service implementation:": "完全なサービス実装を示します：",
  "Batch Operations": "バッチ操作",
  "Use Case: Import Multiple Products": "",
  "Scenario: Admin uploads a CSV file containing multiple products to import.": "",
  "Solution: Process items in parallel using Promise.all for better performance.": "",
  "Chunked Batch Operations": "チャンク化バッチ操作",
  "Use Case: Large Data Migration": "",
  "Scenario: Migrating thousands of records from a legacy system.": "",
  "Problem: Processing all at once may cause Lambda timeout or memory issues.": "",
  "Solution: Process in chunks of 100 items to stay within Lambda limits.": "",
  "Copy Operation": "Copy操作",
  "Use Case: Clone Product to Different Tenant": "",
  "Scenario: Multi-tenant SaaS where a template product needs to be copied to a new tenant.": "",
  "Solution: Read source entity and create new entity with different tenant's keys.": "",
  "Using History Service": "History Serviceの使用",
  "Use Case: View Previous Versions of a Document": "",
  "Scenario: Audit requirement to show what a document looked like at a specific version.": "",
  "Solution: Use HistoryService to retrieve a specific version from the history table.": "",
  "Best Practices": "ベストプラクティス",
  "1. Always Use Invoke Context": "1. 常にInvoke Contextを使用する",
  "Pass invoke context for audit trail:": "監査証跡のためにinvoke contextを渡します：",
  "2. Use Optimistic Locking": "2. 楽観的ロックを使用する",
  "Include version in partial updates:": "部分更新にバージョンを含めます：",
  "3. Prefer Async Operations": "3. 非同期操作を優先する",
  "Use async methods for better responsiveness:": "レスポンシブ性向上のために非同期メソッドを使用します：",
  "4. Combine DynamoDB and RDS Queries": "4. DynamoDBとRDSクエリを組み合わせる",
  "Use DynamoDB for single-item reads, RDS for complex queries:": "単一アイテムの読み取りにはDynamoDB、複雑なクエリにはRDSを使用します："
