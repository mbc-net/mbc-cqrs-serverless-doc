    "Multi-tenancy is built-in - always include tenantCode in operations",
    "Version control is automatic - use VERSION_LATEST constant for latest versions",
    "Data sync handlers are used to synchronize data to external systems like RDS",
    "The framework uses NestJS dependency injection patterns"
